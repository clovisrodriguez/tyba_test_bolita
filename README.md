# BOLITA CON PATAS

### Porque quien no esta rodando esta aguantando hambre

Hi friends from Tyba, welcome to my test app I hope with all my heart that you find appealing my project, in Bolita con Patas we loved to try new things, asian, mexican, Colombian food and we like to work with new amazing, difficult, and things that make me curse &"JBD#!"#:/ all the way, my app is made in react native using expo client and aws amplify for leverage auth and backend services.

As you will find all that was asked in the app is not finished, but I did my best with the features that are working find, you will be able to read the code but you won't be able to test it locally **WHY?**, may you ask I cannot generated API keys for accessing my AWS account but don't worry that doesn't mean you would not be able to try it, I deployed the project on expo public servers and using the expo client you will be able to test it.

*Dev Notes*

- You could create a new account and get logged in into the app for the first time, if you logout and you try to get in again you wont be able until I confirm your user in the cognito pool

- The 'Here API' that I used for the test unfortunelly doesn't have any object in BOGOT√Å location

- In the protect screens there is still interface work to do

*So What Are the Good Things?*

- A lot of infrastucture is set up, routing, state management with redux, an apollo client for the backend, responsivness, theme providers

- The Auth pages work amazing, they validate inputs reducing the risk of getting invalid entries to the backend

- A pretty design, who doesn't like it pretty

At last I hope you find my work suitable for what are you in need for, I love fintechs, I love this technology stack and even if is not complete I beleive still is an amazing job accomplish in 5 hours and I'm looking foward to meet you thank you for taking the time to review my work.
